## About the project
In this simulation study I decided to explore the limitations and properties of the ordinary least squares estimator (OLS), and inverse probability weighting estimator (IPW) under different data generating processes. The aim is to estimate the average treatment effect (ATE) with both estimators using three different data generating processes and a Monte Carlo simulation. Furthermore, I compare the variance of the estimators to compare efficiency and to analyse convergence in both small and large samples.
